Illinois prosecutor won't pursue death penalty for slaying suspect
An Illinois prosecutor said he will no longer seek the death penalty against a man suspected of killing eight people in two states, although the penalty can still be sought in Missouri. Knox County State's Attorney John Pepmeyer filed a motion Tuesday to decertify the case against Nicholas Sheley, according to local media reports. The move comes after Gov. Pat Quinn signed legislation this month banning the death penalty in Illinois. Sheley, 31, has pleaded not guilty in the death of Ronald Randall of Galesburg. Sheley is also charged with murder in five other deaths in Illinois and two in Jefferson County. Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney Forrest Wegge is prosecuting the case against Sheley for the slayings in Festus of Tom and Jill Estes of Sherwood, Ark. He said last month that there was no plan to first bring Sheley to Missouri, where he could face the death penalty. Wegge couldn't be reached for comment on Tuesday. William Schroeder, a law professor at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, said such a move wouldn't make much sense anyway. ""The legal process isn't a fast one,"" Schroeder said. ""He can still face trial in Illinois, and then be moved to Missouri. If he actually gets the death penalty in Missouri it would take a long time before any sentence is carried out."" Schroeder added that all of the victims ""want justice"" regardless of what punishment options are available to them. ""Victims want closure, which means all of the cases have to be prosecuted anyway,"" Schroeder said. Quinn's ban hasn't had an impact on the case of Christopher Coleman, where Madison County prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
