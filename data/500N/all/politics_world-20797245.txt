East Coast services disrupted after collision
Services on the East Coast main line have been badly disrupted after a person was struck by a train. Major delays are being reported between Doncaster and London King's Cross after the incident earlier this afternoon at Grantham, Lincolnshire. Due to this, there are currently no East Coast, First Hull Trains and Grand Central services through the area but First Capital Connect are not affected. It is estimated a normal service will not resume before 2000 BST.
