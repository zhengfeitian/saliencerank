ME&#39;s corpse grab of Officer George Wong &#39;unforgivable&#39; says friend, Officer Bobby Heedles
A crimefighting pal of an NYPD cop killed by cancer has joined critics blasting the city for snatching his body to examine after his death was linked to a 9/11 illness. ""What the medical examiner's office did was unforgivable,"" Officer Bobby Heedles said of a controversy surrounding the remains of retired Officer George Wong. Heedles, 46, worked with Wong in the 1980s at the 5th Precinct stationhouse in Chinatown, and in a letter emailed to the Daily News yesterday described him as having a ""true warrior's spirit."" ""I never met a better human being,"" he wrote, saying Wong never smoked or drank. Born July 4, 1962, Wong died last week from gastric cancer his doctor attributed to 9/11 toxic exposure. Once told of the 9/11 link, the city medical examiner's office seized Wong's body to examine it Monday, angering his family and delaying his funeral a day.
